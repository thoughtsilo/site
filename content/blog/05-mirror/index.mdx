How much clearer I see myself  
Than through the lens of seeing myself through you  
(Reflective piece)  

You place emphasis on your health   
And I can’t help but do the same   
And should run more and play more   
(Motivation piece)  

I see a future version of me that is made up of all the qualities I admire about you   
(Inspiration piece)  

You have helped me learn that it is what it is and being a dick is never cool  
(Teaching piece)  

I can be more myself than I have been for a while with anyone, your touch is so natural   
(Authenticity piece)  

When we hang out it never seems like enough time, it flies when you’re having fun   
(Relativity piece)   

I want you to see the best me and I seem to want to learn and try new things  
(Growth piece)  

I feel a deep esteem that extends into my soul which stems from being truly and authentically seen  
(Peace piece)
