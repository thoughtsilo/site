A million points of light  
Everywhere I look I see light  
Why do they shine so bright

Some shine brighter than others  
Some are dimmer, and unaware that they shine at all  
Others do not even know themselves as light  

But the light we emit, shines through us  
And between us and when we see each other  
seeing others as we see ourselves, unmistakeable

Were it not balanced with darkness   
It would cease to be seen, it would cease to exist  
The darkness in between â€¦ all the points of light  

there is only one but many lights  
the light that breathes life and death  
The light that brings hope and love
