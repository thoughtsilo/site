A million points of light  
Everywhere I look I see light  
Why do they shine so bright

Some shine brighter than others  
Some are dimmer, and unaware that they shine at all  
Others do not even know themselves as light  

But the light we emit, shines through us  
And between us and when we see each other  
Seeing others as we see ourselves, unmistakeable

Were it not balanced with darkness   
It would cease to be seen, it would cease to exist  
The darkness in between … all the points of light  

There are many lights but only one
Light that breathes life and death  
Light that fills all the spaces in between
