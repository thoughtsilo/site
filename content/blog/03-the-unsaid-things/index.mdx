There is a richness in the unsaid things  
The stuff that lies between two people unspoken  
A dream unspoken, a life unspoken   
Whereas the lout who blurts out the obvious to fill the void  
Destroys the perfect moment of harmony that exists when there is silent understanding  
Were a moment of silence inferior, we would never wish to be present within ourselves, within nature

The time between the many lines of a jokes  
The sky around the trees, the sea around a fish  
The negative space, that gives life to the occupier   
Where we may wish to share our deepest concerns with another  
Maybe a love best left unsaid is the most impactful of all, the unrequited, unselfish   
Love does not need a voice but a gentle touch, a kiss on the forehead, unconditional support
