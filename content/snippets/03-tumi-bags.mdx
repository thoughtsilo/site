excerpt: My friend used a Tumi tote the last time I was travelling in Spain and Italy. A great feature of these bags is that they have a pocket which stabilises your tote against the handles of your suitcase. (Making wheeling suitcases over cobblestones roads less annoying), also a variety of pockets in the tote you never knew you needed. Worth checking out if you're a frequent flyer.
