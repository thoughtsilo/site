excerpt: If you're a Harry Potter fan you may want to take the Sorting hat quiz. The test sorts you into Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw. I took the test and got >>> Hufflepuff. I wanted to be a Ravenclaw and took the test again, but alas still a Hufflepuff. Maybe being kind is better than being smart?
